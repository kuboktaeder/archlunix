lunix as in Loser's UNIX

This repository provides scripts and config files to bootstrap 'my' Arch Linux (to be precise: Parabola GNU/Linux-libre) including a comfortable desktop environment. As Arch Linux follows a diy approach and batteries included distros already exist, it might seem a little bit strange that I share my configuration, which is actually not that spectacular.
I do this mainly for myself, so I can document changes I made to the system and easily set up a new system, when I need to. But it makes it also transparent for others helping me to improve my configuration or just want to try them out.
